# Example 1

Create test cases based on this AC:

* Users should be able to import configuration files (legacy format, without the "DisplayName" and "DisplayID" columns) into DataSync Pro
* Even with the legacy format, DataSync Pro should accurately process the configuration without causing data inconsistencies
* The system should handle legacy CSV formats gracefully, without throwing errors
* Application must not crash or become unresponsive during import
* The import process must not interfere with other ongoing processes
* User experience should remain consistent with the experience when using the latest configuration format (excluding display-specific features)
* Since the legacy CSV lacks display-related columns, any display-related counts or metrics should default to zero
